/*
- ordered_map iimplemented using balanced bst so insertion, deletion and search all done in O(logn), gives elms in sorted order according to their keys.
- unordered_map iimplemented using array so insertion, deletion and search all done in O(1) not exactly but nearly

why searching is O(1) in unordered_map?
-> using hash function which consists of hash code(converts input to integer value) and compression function(uss integer ko inside bounds mai lana).
